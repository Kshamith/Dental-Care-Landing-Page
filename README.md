# Dental Care Landing Page - Practice Project

## Overview

This is a simple front-end project created as a practice exercise. The project is a landing page for a dental care website, inspired by the design found on [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/22620941-Dental-Care-Landing-Page). It utilizes HTML and CSS to elegantly showcase a variety of UI elements, animations, and styling techniques, each enriched with my own creative enhancements.

## Project Structure

The project structure is straightforward, containing HTML and CSS files. The HTML file (`index.html`) includes the structure of the landing page, and the CSS file (`style.css`) provides the styling and animations. 

    |-- dental-care-landing-page
        |-- images
            |-- (image files)
        |-- index.html
        |-- style.css
